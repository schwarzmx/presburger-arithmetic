This is a simple application for solving Presburger Arithmetic formulae. It was part of a
final project for my Automata and Formal Languages course.
It's stil kind of buggy but it solves simple formulae. Some optimizations
and shortcut calculations are still missing.

Before building the code, please make sure that ANT is installed. This tool can be used on 
Windows or any *nix system.

To build the code follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to the folder containing the build.xml file (this folder).
3. Type "ant" in the terminal.
4. You will find the PresburgerArithmetic.jar executable in the ./build/jar folder, from 
there or by copying the jar to any folder the jar can be executed.
	
To execute the jar follow this steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the location of the jar file (PresburgerArithmetic.jar).
3. Type "java -jar PresburgerArithmetic.jar <filename>", where filename is the name of the
txt file containing the formula to be processed. The file should be preferably in the same 
folder as the JAR file. If not specify the complete path to it.
4. Wait until the program terminates.
5. Expect a file with the same filename but with a .dotty extension at the end, this will 
containing the Dotty description for the final automaton.
